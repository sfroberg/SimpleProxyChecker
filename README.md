SimpleProxyChecker
==================

Simple Proxy Checker is currently an beta status project (crashes more than likely).

It will contain proxy fetcher and simplistic proxy checker.

Help needed from people who can do the following:

  1.  Code with C++ 
  2.  Are familiar with Qt framework and maybe with QtCreator IDE too
  3.  Have knowledge of multithreading and especially of Qt multithreading. Important because                                    I have almost zero knowledge of multithreading.

This code is originally from my other project CyberDragon browser: http://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberdragonbrowser/
I decided to open source this part of code because tired of constant crashes and other issues with proxy checker code.

With your help it will get better.
